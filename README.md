## Usage & Installation

  To use the program, the repository needs to be cloned and forked to your local machine. From the root directory of the application, open the terminal and run the `npm i` or `npm install` command in to download all dependencies. Next, the database needs to be initiated with `mysql -u root -p`. Once initiated, the tables need to be created by entering the command `source db/schema.sql`. Exit the sql terminal and then run the command `npm run seed` to feed the seed data into the tables. Lastly, enter the command `npm start` or `npm run watch` (if using nodemon) to initiate the server.
